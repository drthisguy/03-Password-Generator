Known issues.

template literals are used therfore, this app is not compatible with older (pre ES6) browsers.  the innerHTML property is in use as well.  Here, it is done in a way so that there are no real security issues since only valid numbers can be read out from the input fields. If a valid length is not taken in the innerHTML property does not execute.
